Structuring JavaScript Code
===========================

## Working on my blog

This will be an entry for my Github blog, it will either be written in Python.
Using the Flask micro framework (because I like things like this eg: Sinatra, Express).
Or I'll just use Jekyll or Octopress, which is what it is currently but I'm the,
adventurous type and want to do it differently.

The design was done in the browser so I will have to redo the css later
to modernize it so to speak.
