Structuring JavaScript Code
===========================

## Working on my blog

This will be an entry for my Github blog, it will either be written in Python.
Using the Flask micro framework (because I like things like this eg: Sinatra, Express).

Or I'll just use Jekyll or Octopress, which is what it is currently but I'm the,
adventurous type and want to do it differently, so it will probably be done with the
Flask framework.

The design was done in the browser so I will have to redo the css later
to modernize it so to speak.

### todos
1. Fix responsive media query for iphone 5S.
2. Finish the tutorial.
3. Integrate with Blog.
4. Tweak Navigation Styles (although this isn't about styling, I can't have my work looking sloppy.)
